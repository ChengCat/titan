*  To do recovery properly, the grammar needs a rule to consume a token. This rule will
   be used while trying to reach a synchronization token

*  The recovery pattern associated with label NameRecord (Err_007) will not work, because
   it is the same pattern (NAME) that failed to match in the regular grammar.

*  The original grammar uses the same set of labels (six in total) for 'import' and 'foreign' rules 

*  The label DeclParList is used by rules 'declist' and 'paramlist', but each rule has a different
   recovery expression associated with this labels. I am using two distinct labels: DeclList and ParamList
   In 'first.lua', I need to check the computatation of FOLLOW in case of an expression p*.
   It seems that ',' should be in the recovery expression of DeclParList.

*  The label TypeDecl is also used by two rules, 'param' and 'decl', but has different recovery expressions
   in each rule. I will use TypeParam for 'param' and TypeDecl for 'decl'.
