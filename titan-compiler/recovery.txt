*  To do recovery properly, the grammar needs a rule to consume a token. This rule will
   be used while trying to reach a synchronization token

*  The recovery pattern associated with label NameRecord (Err_007) will not work, because
   it is the same pattern (NAME) that failed to match in the regular grammar.

*  The original grammar uses the same set of labels (six in total) for 'import' and 'foreign' rules
